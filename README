Configuration
=============
You may install sample configuration files by doing "make samples".  Also you 
will need to edit your Asterisk configuration files to enable the GUI properly,
specifically:

1) In http.conf:

	enabled = yes
	enablestatic = yes
	
2) In manager.conf

	enabled = yes
	webenabled = yes
	
3) Create an appropriate entry in manager.conf for the administrative user
(PLEASE READ THE security.txt FILE!)

    [admin]
    secret = thiswouldbeaninsecurepassword
    read = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,config
    write = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,config

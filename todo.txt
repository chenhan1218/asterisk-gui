Todo
----- 

* Voicemail Groups

* Option to configure the default context 'disa' for DISA

* Call Forwarding

* CDR Configuration page from patch http://bugs.digium.com/view.php?id=10306 (bbryant)

* Label/Tag/Name Analog Channels for presentation in GUI

* Directory management - A printable sheet of users and numbers
  (For the time being you can create an IVR and use the directory option )

*  it would be very usefull, to define the max time a client can be in the queue.. so we can put a voice telling "Please leva a meesage we will cal you back" in a vm..   or something like that :) -- killfill on irc

* Finish multiple language support (lang.js) 

* All system path variables should be able to edit via GUI.

* If the timeout option for the dial app is not set, do not add a comma ;[ I will fix this tomorrow, along with other options for the Dial() app inside ringgroups.html (where the problem currently exists.) 

* In addition to build_action, if you are updating an extension, be able to easily add application specific parameteres

* Make sure all settings and configuration for the ITSPs are included in the setup wizards service providers page

* Ability to download config backup files and restore them via file uploads

* Add the GUI version string inside extensions.conf, so the setup wizard can decide if it needs to update the guitools context.

* Ability to instead maintain two versions of a file (eg 4.html (step 3) and trunks.html (service providers)) so just include trunks.html into the 4.html page, instead of writing it twice and fixing bugs twice.
	The merges from their parent files (trunks.html to 4.html respectively) do not usually get changed in their Setup Wizard equivalent, and can be extremely confusing. (bkruse) (or anyone)
